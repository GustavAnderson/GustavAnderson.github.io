	<p> Recieved a PhD in Mouth Feel Psychology as well as a Masters in Business Fraud at Cheeks University. He took a sabbatical in Chad for two years where he joined a nudist colony in the jungle and studied how to put larger quantities of food in his mouth at one time. During this time Gus also interviewd 69 gorillas about their eating habits and how they relate to human eating habits. He wrote a formal thesis on this project and it concluded that gorillas and humans only share 4/20 dietary habits with each other. Now back in Maine, he helped start Dank Food Reviews with his close friends on Youtube in order to inform the public of the true dankness of food. </p>
