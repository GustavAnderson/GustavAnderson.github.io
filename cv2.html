	<p> While attending Walls College, Shane acquired a Masters in Creampie Chemestry. Once he left college, Shane immediately started an internship with Bill Cosby where he refined his experience in the field of Creampie Chemistry. He also gained hands on experience with tasting and reviewing liquids. Eventually, Shane quit his internship and started his own bottled water company where he sold high end H20 for $42.69 a bottle in third world countries. Needless to say this buisness venture did not last long. Eventually, he reunited with his dear comrades from back home in Maine and founded the beloved Dank Food Reviews channel we all know and love today. </p>
