	<p> This guy never attended college. Once Mo left high school, he immediately took to the streets of Portland, Maine where he stalked interesting people in order to observe a diverse range of human behavior. Mo eventually reached enlightenment and took a vow of silence for two years in order to connect better with the souls of people he met. Mooching off of the good will of strangers for two years, Mo finally decided to end his vow and pursue another calling. He began breaking into Best Buys around Maine in order to learn the ways of computer tech, videomaking, and deepweb browsing. He also became addicted to the smells of various food products. Due to the constant engaging in fisticuffs with homeless people in the streets over scaveneged video cameras and smelly trash, Mo found himself doing hard time in the local clink. In Prison, Mo began a weekly Luau with his fellow inmates in which they sang, danced, and practiced talking extremely close to human faces. Mo got out of prison after a year and a half. Eventually, Gus and Shane remembered their close friend Mo, and invited him to help create Dank Food Reviews. </p>
